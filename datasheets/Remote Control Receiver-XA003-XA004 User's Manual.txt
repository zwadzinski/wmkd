Hardware connection between controller core and remote
control transmitter/receiver shield
As shown in the figure, the controller core, the remote control receiver shield, and the
remote control transmitter shield have antenna symbols. When making the connection,
it is necessary to ensure that the orientations of these three symbols are the same
and the pins correspond to each other one by one.

Orientations of these three symbols are the same.

Pins correspond to each other one by one.

Connect to the RC Transmitter& Receiver on the PC client.
Power the controller core through the Type-C port or the XH2.54 Power Port on the
expansion shield.

Run CyberBrick client, switch to Device Management

Click [+] to find your device

Connect the device by entering the PIN code. If the PIN hasn't been set during the
first connection, confirm directly.

After successful connection, the indicator of controller core lights blue, and the client
displays this device.

Click on the expansion symbol in the upper right corner of the device. If you have
connected multiple devices, click on Recognize, the status indicator of the selected

device will flash green; if you need to disconnect with the selected device, click on
Disconnect.

Click on the device, you can change the name of the device in the upper right corner
to make it easier to identify it when there are multiple devices.

If you need to change the Pin code of the device, you can click Modify in the lower
right corner and enter the new Pin code.

Configure the core controller profile
Click on the Configuration, click on Create Configuration, and start with a template, or
an empty configuration[Custom].

Here we take the custom empty configuration as an example, click on Custom and
then click on Edit in the configuration list below.

After entering the configuration interface, first, click Add Receiver on the left side, and
input the name of the receiver.

Click on the hardware connection above and drag the receiver device and controller
device to the corresponding position.

Click to start pairing. After pairing successfully, the status indicators of these devices
should flash blue and yellow alternately.

After modifying the configuration, remember to save the configuration locally with
Save Config in the upper right corner, and update the configuration to the device with
Send Config.
